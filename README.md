# web-scraping
Scrapes indeed for jobs matching the fields you input.

## How to use:
- Run `pip install .` in the terminal to install the required dependencies  
 
- Then type in `python main.py` for the program to start

### Note
The salary feature only works for dollars  
Will be adding support for more currencies soon
